### Todos, Features, Issues
- Todos:
    - [ ] add github repo as projects
    - [ ] add deamo argumentation maps
    - [ ] when starting browser let user decide for memory sessions o persistent storage (and support the blog author)
    - [x] Create a two browser e2e tests with two browsers 
        - [x] create a blog and two posts
        - [x] open a second browser with that /#/orbitdb/address in the url wait for replication
        - [ ] add a post A - wait for replication in browser B
        - [ ] drop db in browser A - create same blog name again in browser A - wait for replication from browser B (webrtc)
        - [x] drop db in browser A - create same blog name again in browser A - wait for replication from pinning service

    - [x] first time loading seems still slow - what can be optimized?
        - [ ] if persistent storage and peerId is temporary same indexDB should be used anyways (do not crea~e new indexDB for every session)
        - [ ] display used/available storage of index db 
    -  ~~[ ] Feature: Make voyager host configurable via settings (everybody should be able to use its own private voyager(s)~~
    - [ ] Feature: Implement IPNS-OrbitDB-blockchain-link: Store an OrbitDB-Address in a blockchain transaction (e.g. Namecoin) name: ipns/example.com / ipns/ipnspubkey value: /orbitdb/address - when a website / app is loaded via ipns e.g. example-com/ipns.localhost:8081 pwa can extract the ipns name from the hostname and lookup an OrbitDB from a blockchain to load as default! Also set x-ipfs-path in nginx header.
    - [x] BUG: during a demo with a blogger, I couldn't add his orbitdb address
    - [x] BUG: add remote db didn't work (mermaid)
    - [x] add a publish state (unpublished / published) to PostList and PostForm and only show published posts 
    - [ ] bug: when unpublish a translated post other related posts in other languages should be unpublished too (optional)
    - [x] bug: when deleting a translated post other related posts in other languages should be deleted too (optional)
    - [x] UI-Bug: Navigation tattered.
    - [x] UI-Bug: iOS-Mobile looks terrible.
    - [x] UI-Bug: If a post isn't translated into the current language, try other fallback (browser) languages otherwise en, zh, hi, es
    - [ ] UI-Bug: Translate button doesn't do anything while translating - we need to animate the button a little bit better (LED's need to reactively work while translation is ongoing)
    - [ ] Feature: when adding IPFS-image links into markdown, it should also parse external CIDs not just cids which are inside our media library
    - [x] Bug: Peer-to-Peer between browsers broken (WebRTC upgrade from circuit-relay-v2)
    - [ ] Feature: Instead of an own article link external
        - [ ] in posts it needs filetype link which syncs the remote db (with all comments and media)

    - [ ] Feature: if a IPFS-CID is discovered during saving of the article it should be directly gathered from the IPFS-network and added to the posts media ids and pinned to the local Helia node  
    - [ ] Feature: if a IPFS-CID is discovered in preview mode, it should be loaded and pinned locally too! 
    - [ ] Bug: locks & keys in sidebar are updating too late
    - [x] Feature: make use of @libp2p/logging
    - [x] GDPR-Question: When entering the website and loading remote blocks they get stored on the local browser, what does the GDPR says to that? 
    - [x] Feature: use @libp2p/logging package
    - [x] UI-BUG: If old posts doesn't have a language it will never be displayed (and swallowed by the system)
        - [ ] GDPR is only about personal data e.g. a token in local storage is personal data, being transparent is never an issue.
    - [x] Feature: Add synchronous password encryption to a blogPost 
    - [x] Bug: Website in browsers and mobile apps pwa is cached too long: nginx must send no-cache header

    - [x] editable, deletable, history only when write access
    - [x] comments can't be stored anymore
    - [x] when switching network off, blog should read local db and not connect. At the moment it tries to connect online and fail
