## Description

Le Space-Blog is a decentralized blogging application that leverages OrbitDB for peer-to-peer data replication and IPFS for content storage. It enables users to create, manage, and share blog content in a decentralized manner, so blog posts are stored with the blog author and their readers maintain a replica via peer-to-peer connections.
Since this would require the blog author to leave his browser open 24/7 for the readers to read the blog, soon we offer blog pinning nodes for blog authors, which can be run at home (self hosted) on your desktop or as RaspberryPi image in your living room, as docker image if you want to install it on a cloud server or as a paid service.

## Installation

### As Progressive Web App (PWA)

Visit our IPNS link (requires [IPFS Companion](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-companion/)):
- IPNS: [ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dixys1k2prgbng4z9uxgvc4kj8l1xww1v5irt5cn3j5q402a0yb](https://k51qzi5uqu5dixys1k2prgbng4z9uxgvc4kj8l1xww1v5irt5cn3j5q402a0yb.ipns.dweb.link/)

- ‚úÖ Internationalization (en, de, fr, es, it, ru, zh, ar, tr)
- ‚úÖ URL hash routing for blog sharing
- ‚úÖ LibP2P-Transport via secure Websocket, WebRTC and Webtransport

## Logging Configuration

The web application uses the flexible libp2p logging system. You can configure the logging level through the browser's console. Checkout the following log levels:
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'le-space:*') observers the le-space blog internals db and replication operations
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'libp2p:circuit-relay:*,libp2p:discovery:*,libp2p:dcutr:*') observes circuit-relay, peer discovery, dcutr important for peer-to-peer communication between browsers
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'libp2p:*,helia:*,le-space:blog:*') observers all logs of libp2p, helia and le-space blog


#### Using Environment Variables
When running the application locally, you can set the log level using an environment variable:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm run dev
```

### Default Log Level
By default, the application logs at the `info` level, which provides a good balance between useful information and console clutter.
